Audio producer @TechReview, host @soonishpodcast, columnist @sciam, author @mitpress, co-founder @hubspokeaudio, PhD @MITPSTS","Wade Roush.I""ve been covering technology and science for 25 years, and I believe we have a lot more power to shape the future than we think.On balance, science and technology are the biggest forces improving our lives on this planet—but like any force, they can seem a bit impersonal. My view is that we can be a lot more intentional and proactive about how the process plays out. I""m always searching for new insights about the workings of science and technology in society, and I love to share those insights through audio storytelling.As for my background: I""ve written a lot for print magazines, notably Science, MIT Technology Review, and Scientific American, as well as online publications, especially Xconomy. In 2014-15 I was acting director of MIT""s Knight Science Journalism fellowship program. I""ve also done stints at NASA and an early e-book startup called NuvoMedia.I""m trained as a historian of science and technology. I have a BA in that field from Harvard College and a PhD from the Program in Science, Technology, and Society at MIT. I live in Cambridge, Massachusetts with my dog, Gryphon.As a longform narrative writer, I appreciate the power of text. But for years I envied the way radio and podcast producers can use voice, sound, and music to tell gripping stories. So in 2015 I decided to learn radio. I""ve done a few feature stories for public radio, like this story and this story for WBUR and this story for WHYY. Soonish was my first big solo adventure in audio. In addition to producing the podcast, I write freelance articles and do consulting work for startups. I was the editor of the 2018 edition of Twelve Tomorrows, MIT Technology Review""s annual anthology of hard science fiction stories. In 2019 I helped Technology Review start an interview podcast called Business Lab, and now I produce and host a twice-monthly show for the magazine called Deep Tech. In April 2020 the MIT Press published my book about the search for extraterrestrial life and extraterrestrial",2024-04-08 07:37:16.000,false

173257,Rachel Lucas,48633,,,,"14778, 19919","Surgery, Health, Social Affairs",,"Rachel is a TV and soaps journalist for magazines and the web. For the last 15 years she’s covered the dramas, deaths and disasters of soapland for the likes of What’s On TV, TV Times and Soaplife. Watch Rachel weekdays from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. on Virginia Today. Home is where the heart is, and for Rachel Lucas her heart is right here in Southwest Virginia. No stranger to the Appalachian Mountains, Rachel grew up on a farm in Giles County and is thrilled to be providing news coverage for the place she calls home. Rachel has helped WSLS 10 win multiple awards for team coverage of various breaking news events across the region, including her investigative reporting of the after effects of the Lynchburg train derailment, which spilled thousands of gallons of Bakken crude oil into the James River. Earning the trust of WSLS 10 viewers, she is more than familiar with the issues that affect the region. She understands our viewers because she has and always will be a member of our community. After graduating from Giles High School in 2006, Rachel pursued her dream of journalism at Concord University in Athens, West Virginia. While a Mountain Lion, she competed for Concord’s All-Girl Division II cheerleading squad and represented her sorority Alpha Sigma Alpha as President and Concords 2009 Homecoming Queen. She started in news at her college news station and with an internship reporting for West Virginia Public Broadcasting. She landed her first job at WVVA News in Bluefield, West Virginia shortly after graduation. While in the Mountain State, Rachel launched WVVA’s first news bureau in Greenbrier County. There, she covered everything from the storm damage after the derecho, to the excitement of the PGA Tours Greenbrier Classic. While reporting on the front lines at Virginia Tech, Rachel helped her news team receive Best Spot News Award from the West Virginia Broadcasters Association for their coverage of the tragic shooting of a Virginia Tech police officer. While working in the station’s home base nestled in East River Mountain, it wasn’t out of the ordinary for a bear or any other wild critter to pay a visit to the newsroom – one of Rachel’s favorite memories from working in Bluefield. From breaking news in weather including the devastating EF3 tornado that hit Appomattox, to top stories in crime, politics, the environment, economics and health, Rachel has in-depth experience in covering a variety of topics in our region. Rachel also enjoys covering stories that feature the strengths of the local community and its people. A true animal lover, Rachel especially enjoys covering topics that have anything to do educating the public about conservation of wildlife. When she has time, she enjoys volunteering at the Southwest Virginia Wildlife in Roanoke, helping where she can to rehabilitate injured or orphaned wildlife. An avid Hokie and Redskins fan, Rachel is excited to be in the commonwealth with her husband Andy who is also a member of the WSLS 10 team, they live in Roanoke with their two dogs Gibbs, Phoenix and cat Artemis. The best part of the weekend is spent on a nice Sunday family dinner which is only a short drive away. Rachel loves hearing from viewers!
